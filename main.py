#Task 1.
#Write a program for selling tickets to IT-events. Each ticket has a unique number and a price.
#There are four types of tickets: regular ticket, advance ticket (purchased 60 or more days before the event),
#late ticket (purchased fewer than 10 days before the event) and student ticket.
#Additional information:
#-advance ticket - discount 40% of the regular ticket price;
#-student ticket - discount 50% of the regular ticket price;
#-late ticket - additional 10% to the reguler ticket price.
#All tickets must have the following properties:
#-the ability to construct a ticket by number;
#-the ability to ask for a ticketâ€™s price;
#-the ability to print a ticket as a String.
